Jet Aircraft Trajectory Prediction based upon BADA

Aircraft trajectory prediction based upon BADA

This software is written in Python 2.7. 
It allows to compute aircraft (jet) trajectories. 
Three kind of outputs are generated. 
A Google Earth KML file and two xlsx containing the vertical flight profile and the lateral profile.
