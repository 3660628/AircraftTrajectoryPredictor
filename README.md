Aircraft trajectory prediction based upon BADA<br>
https://www.eurocontrol.int/services/bada

This software is written in Python 2.7.<br>
https://www.python.org/

It allows to compute aircraft (jet) trajectories. 
Three kind of outputs are generated. 
A Google Earth KML file and two xlsx containing the vertical flight profile and the lateral profile. 
This software needs Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) and XlsxWriter (https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.org/)
